			<dt>Why is a traditional family important?</dt>
			<dd>Traditional families are ordained of God. In His infinite wisdom, He organized the structure of families to have a man and a woman lead their children and teach them proper values, manners, and responsibilities. Having traditional marriage brings both the traits of males and females together to lend great strength to families.</dd>
			<dt>Is the traditional family under attack?</dt>
			<dd>Yes. The morals and values that are important to traditional families are being eroded from our society. Marriage is becoming optional. Pornograpghy is running rampart. Manâ€™s law is trying to overwrite what God has defined marriage as. In short the family is under attack</dd>
			<dt>What can I do?</dt>
			<dd>Stand up for traditional marriage. This can be in many ways, including sending letters to representatives who are voting on bills that will affect the family. The most important, though, is to help your family understand the importance of traditional family.</dd>
